# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a callable action that preforms a task that can be passed arguments.

  Researched answer: A function is a JavaScript procedure or set of statements that performs a task.



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: A map goes through your array and preforms an action and outputs the result of that action into a new array, and a filter extracts information based on your criteria from an array

  Researched answer: A map maniuplates iterables versus an filter filters iterables based on a condition.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: Console.log prints directly to the console, and return sends the value at the end of a function to what called the function.

  Researched answer: Console.log is a function that logs the arguments you pass to the web console. Return is a statement which specifies the value returned from a function.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: Arguments are the information that you pass into a function.

  Researched answer: An argument of a function is a value that must be provided to obtain the function's result.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming is when two developers work together in coding on one machine. One driving, typing all the code for their logic, while the other navigates, and provides logic for their code. 

  Researched answer: Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the “driver”, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the “navigator”; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: TDD or test driven development is a situation where the developer is testing their functions as they are made to make sure that the logic works properly.

  Researched answer: Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for every small functionality of an application.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: We were given the opportunity to work on our group projects in class with our partners which helped me personally practice what we were learning with an unclear path to a difficult objective.
